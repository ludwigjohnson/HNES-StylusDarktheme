# HNES-StylusDarktheme
CSS for the Stylus browser plugin that gives a basic dark theme compatible with the Hackernews Enhancement Suite (HNES) extension

## Install
Create a new style for news.ycombinator.com using the Stylus extension and import the contents of [HNESDarktheme.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludwigjohnson/HNES-StylusDarktheme/master/HNESDarktheme.css) as Mozilla Format. This should give a basic dark theme that is compatible with the [HNES extension](https://github.com/etcet/HNES). I've only done some basic testing for some of the pages available on HN so there might be some bugs. It should work ok for viewing the homepage and reading comments.
